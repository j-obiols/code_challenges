# Reverse Words

### Google Code Jam Qualification Round Africa 2010

<br>

Given a list of space separated words, reverse the order of the words. 

A line will only consist of letters and space characters. 

There will be exactly one space character between each pair of consecutive words.

For instance, the reverse of **“this is a test”** is **“test a is this”**, the reverse of **“foobar”** is **“foobar”**, 

and the reverse of **“all your base”** is **“base your all”**.
